# Area Trainer

Area Trainer is a programme for you to practise calculating the areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles, fully written in Python.
The programme serves as a useful tool for test and examination revision.
You can choose to do short answer questions or multiple choice questions.

* Note: You have to put the "users.json" file in the same location as "Area_Trainer.py" or else the code won't function properly.

## Scoring

In short answer questions, you will have five attempts to answer the question correctly.

- First attempt: 5 points
- Second attempt: 4 points
- Third attempt: 3 points
- Fourth attempt: 2 points
- Fifth attempt: 1 point

In multiple choice questions, you will only have one attempt to answer the question correctly.
If your answer is correct, you will gain 3 points.

If you answer any question wrong, you will not gain any points.

## Future Plans
- Improve exception handling.
- Turn Area Trainer into a fully-functional Discord bot with a global leaderboard system.
- Make questions more "random".
